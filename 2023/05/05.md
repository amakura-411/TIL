## Topic

Studying TypeScript and React/Next.js.

## Purpose

I will learn TypeScript and  try making an sample application.

## Details

I make sample app with "TypeScriptとReact/Next.js"でつくる実践アプリケーション開発".

## Achievements

I can use react on terminal.
<how-to>
1. Create a new React app.
2. Create a new file named 'docker-compose.yml' in the root directory of your React app.
3. Add the following code to the 'docker-compose.yml'.
```
version: '3'
services:
  node:
    image: node
    ports:
      -'3000:3000'
    volumes:
      -  './:/usr/src/app'
    working_dir: /usr/src/app
    command: bash
```
4. Open a terminal window in the root directory of your React app and the command 'docker-compose up'.
5. Once the container is running open a new terminal windows and run the commnad 'docker-compose exec node bash'.
6. Inside the container,run the command 'npm install -g typescript'.
7. To run a TypeScript file, navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the command'npx ts-node <filename>'.
If the name of the app is 'app.tsx', you can run it trying 'npx ts-node app.tsx' in the terminal.
