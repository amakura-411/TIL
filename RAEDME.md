# Today I Learned (TIL)

This repository contains my daily logs of things I learn day by day. It's like a personal diary where I document my progress in various technical topics.

## Contents

The contents of this repository are organized by date, and each day has its own markdown file containing the relevant log.

## Topics

In addition to the language, framework, and tools I learn, I may also include entries on topics such as:

- Programming Languages (e.g. JavaScript, Python, Ruby, etc.)
- Databases (e.g. SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Web Development (e.g. HTML/CSS, Node.js, React, Vue.js, etc.)
- Mobile Development (e.g. iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, etc.)
- Machine Learning (e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Data Science (e.g. NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.)
- Best Coding Practices (e.g. clean code, testing, design patterns, etc.)
- Tools (e.g. Git, VSCode, Docker, etc.)
- Technical Books (e.g. "Clean Code", "Designing Data-Intensive Applications", etc.)

## Motivation

My goal with this repository is to keep track of my progress as a developer and to share my knowledge with others. I also hope to use it as a reference for future projects and job interviews.

Thank you for reading!
